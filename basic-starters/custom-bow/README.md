# Custom Bow Template
This template was provided by [Alien Edds](https://github.com/Alien-Edds)

> ⚠️ This template does not include the compiler like the default template does. This is a manual workspace.

TypeScript files are in ``scripts``, JS files are in ``BP/scripts``. 

## This is confusing, what files do i actually need?
The only files that you need for this to work is everything that's in the ``BP`` and ``RP``.
